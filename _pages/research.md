# Work in progress

## Labor market tightness and recruiter's responses (with [Roland Rathelot](http://rolandrathelot.com/))
)

This project studies the way recruiters react to exogenous shocks in their labor market. Using detailed online vacancy data as well as administrative unemployment data we study the different margins of adjustments and the relevant signals. 

## Providing information to recruiters (with [Roland Rathelot](http://rolandrathelot.com/))

This project studies the impact of providing information to recruiters about their labor market. Especially we consider the different channels through which employers react and the endline impact on hirings. 

## Labor supply constraint in HANK (with [Naomi Cohen](https://www.naomicohen.fr/) and   [Nicolas Ghio](https://nicolasghio.github.io/))

We document strong heterogeneities in labor supply constraint along the earnings distribution.
