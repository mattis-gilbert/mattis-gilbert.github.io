## How do recruiters and job seekers adjust their behaviour to labour-market tightness? (JMP)

This project studies how employers and unemployed job seekers adjust their behavior as a function of labour-market tightness. I use detailed online vacancy data as well as unemployment registry data to build local labor market measures of tightness. I study the different margins of adjustments of recruiters and job seekers to tightess. Joint with social-security data I look at how these behaviors impact the dynamics of matching efficiency.
