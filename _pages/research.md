# Work in progress

## How do recruiters and job seekers adjust their behaviour to labour-market tightness? (JMP)

This project studies how employers and unemployed job seekers adjust their behavior as a function of labour-market tightness. I use detailed online vacancy data as well as unemployment registry data to build local labor market measures of tightness. I study the different margins of adjustments of recruiters and job seekers to tightess. Joint with social-security data I look at how these behaviors impact the dynamics of matching efficiency.

## Providing Labor Market Information to Recruiters

This project aims to measure the degree of misinformation recruiters face when posting job ads. We study the impact of providing information to recruiters about their relevant labor market. Especially we consider the different channels through which employers react and the endline impact on hirings. 

## Do Recruiters Benchmark the Competition?

## Labor Constraints and the Desire to Work More

Using the French Labor Force Survey, we find that underemployment is concentrated among low wage rate workersâ€”who also tend to have high marginal propensities to consume, lack savings, and face borrowing constraints. This project aims to explore how such labor constraints affect the welfare distribution of macroeconomic shocks.
