* Whether it is about one's research or teaching, presenting technical concepts in a clear way is at the core of a Ph.D student's life! This can be challenging but also very rewarding! Here is a slideshow about [Marginal Treatment Effect](https://mattis-gilbert.github.io/files/marginal_treatment_effects.pdf) I presented at Sciences Po's Labor/Public reading group.
* For 2 years I have been co-organizing monthly sessions of Sciences Po's Ph.D Breakfast. We invite faculty members (and external speakers) to talk about their field of research or to give advices on topics related to Ph.D / research in economics around the breakfast table! 
* On my spare time I like to play guitar (and sing along). I coded this [VScode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=mattjs07.chordpro-vscode&ssr=false#overview) to write and compile guitar tabs in ChordPro language.
